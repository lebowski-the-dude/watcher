# Why?
I needed some kind of utility to check if there is anyone else on a machine.

# And?
This util checks logged in users and if there more than needed - reports in Telegram.
Mb in future I will add another ways of sending a report.

# How?
./watcher [number of allowed logged in users] [telegram token] [telegram chat ID]

Ex:

./watcher 0 1111111111:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 1111111111
